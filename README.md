Step 1:
I used the D3 library to read in the json file from the URL, and verified on the console that the data was there.

Step2:

- Horizontal bar chart:

I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual.

  * Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

  * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

  * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.


- Bubble chart

Next, I was able to create a buble chart which displays each sample

  * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the y values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

  * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.
